#Steps
# if a container gets deleted then content of container will not be deleted if its mapped with docker volume.
# 1. Create a docker volume inside the Machine.
# 2. We will create a container with a directory mapped with that docker volume.
# 3. We will enter inside container & we will create some files in that specific directory.
# 4. Now we will come out of the container & we will inspect the docker volume to identify location where docker vol is present.
# 5. When you go the docker vol you will see the same files you xreate in step 3.

#create a volume with name my_vol
docker volume create my_vol

#list all volumes
docker volume ls

#create a container with name webapp1 and inside that container there is con_vol directory would be created which is mounted with my_vol ( which is present in machine)
# one extra space is not allowed gives an error
docker run -it --name=webapp1 --mount source=my_vol,destination=/con_vol ubuntu /bin/bash

# go inside container & create files & then exit.
  cd con_vol/
  touch file1 file2 file3 file4
  ls
# After exiting from container remove container
  docker rm webapp1
# inspect container will display doker volume's details 
  docker inspect my_vol

# output of docker inspect my_vol

# Can we mount a docker volume on an existing container?
## No, volume has to be created before container.
